## Working with the WestGrid Server ##

### Introduction to WestGrid ###
WestGrid is a government funded program designed to provide researchers access to high performance computational machines and distributed data storage. It is a system of nodes (or machines that act like individual computers) whose memory can be used to run complex functions and store data in a way that allows access to many individuals. 

The WestGrid server setup can be visualized like this:
